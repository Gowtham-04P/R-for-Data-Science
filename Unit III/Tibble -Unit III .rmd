Tibbles with tibble

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Creating Tibbles
```{r}
as_tibble(iris)
```
```{r}
tibble(
 x = 1:5,
 y = 1,
 z = x ^ 2 + y
)

```

```{r}
tb <- tibble(
 `:)` = "smile",
 ` ` = "space",
 `2000` = "number"
)
tb
```
Tibbles Versus data.frame

There are two main differences in the usage of a tibble versus a clas‐
sic data.frame: printing and subsetting.

Printing
Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10
rows, and all the columns that fit on screen

```{r}
tibble(
 a = lubridate::now() + runif(1e3) * 86400,
 b = lubridate::today() + runif(1e3) * 30,
 c = 1:1e3,
 d = runif(1e3),
 e = sample(letters, 1e3, replace = TRUE)
)
```

Subsetting

If you want to pull out a single variable, you need some new
tools, $ and [[. [[ can extract by name or position; $ only extracts
by name but is a little less typing:

```{r}
df <- tibble(
 x = runif(5),
 y = rnorm(5)
)

```

```{r}
df$x
df[["x"]]
df[[1]]

```
