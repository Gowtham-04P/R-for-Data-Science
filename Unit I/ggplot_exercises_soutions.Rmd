### ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS AND SOLUTIONS

#### Introduction Exercises:  

1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?  

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

**Observations:**

  - Creates an empty canvas with no layers on it.

2. How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?  

**Number of rows:**
```{r}
nrow(mpg)
```


**Number of columns:**
```{r}
ncol(mpg)
```


3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.  

```{r}
?mpg
```

drv
f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd

4. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.  

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
```


5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?  

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```


**Observations:**
  - The plot has fewer data points which is a result of plotting two categorical variables in a scatterplot
  - It results in fewer combinations, that we cannot even see the cluster of data points as a result of overplotting. Hence, the plot not useful.

#### Aesthetic Mappings Exercises:

1. What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

**Observations:**
  - color argument is inside aesthetics. It should be in the geometric object like in the following code to change the color of the data points to blue.
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```
  

2. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg?

**Observations:**
  - Categorical variables in mpg dataset are : manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class
  - Continuous variables are : displ

```{r}
mpg
```


3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

**Observations:**

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = displ, color = class))
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = displ, size = class))
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = displ, shape = class))
```


4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = hwy, size = displ))
```


5. What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

```{r}
?geom_point
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "black", fill = "white", size = 5, stroke = 5)
```


6. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ<5))
```

**Observations:**
  - The condition helps to filter the observations

#### Geometric Objects Exercises:

1. What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
``` 
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = hwy))
``` 
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_area(mapping = aes(x = displ,y = hwy))
```
    

    2. Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

    3. What does show.legend = FALSE do? What happens if you remove it? Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

**Observations:**
  - show.legend = FALSE removes or hides the legend or label of the groups
  - When not using color attribute in aesthetics, removing show.legend = FALSE, still hides the legend
  - It have been used earlier in the chapter since, setting color attribute will set the show.legend = TRUE by default whereas setting group aesthetic does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms.
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv))
```
    
    
    4. What does the se argument to geom_smooth() do?

**Observations:**
  - se argument to geom_smooth if set TRUE adds standard error band to the loess line, removes the confidence interval , if set FALSE
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), se = TRUE)
```
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), se = FALSE)
```
    
    
    5. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?
    
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

**Observations:**   
  - Two graphs are same.
  - because they both use the same mappings
  - they can be set as a global mapping instead of repeating twice in each of their local mappings of geom_smooth() and  geom_point().
  

    6. Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

  
  ![](images/1.png)
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = drv), se = FALSE) +
  geom_point()
```
  
  
  ![](images/2.png)
  
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
  
  
  ![](images/3.png)
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
  
  
  ![](images/4.png)
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
```
  
  
  ![](images/5.png)
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ,y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "white") +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))
```

#### Statistical Transformations Exercises

1. What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

**Observations:**   
  - The default geom associated with stat_summary() is geom_pointrange() with stat property set to "summary"


** Plot using stat_summary():  **   

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  stat_summary(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
               fun.ymin = min,
               fun.ymax = max,
               fun.y = median)
```

** Plot without using stat_summary() instead using default geom_pointrange()   **   

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
                  stat = "summary",
                  fun.ymin = min,
                  fun.ymax = max,
                  fun.y = median)
```


2. What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?

  - There are two types of bar charts: geom_bar() and geom_col(). 
  - geom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group (or if the weight aesthetic is supplied, the sum of the weights). 
  - If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data, use geom_col() instead. 
  - geom_bar() uses stat_count() by default: it counts the number of cases at each x position. 
  - geom_col() uses stat_identity(): it leaves the data as is.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```


3. Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

some of the geoms and their default stats:

  - geom_bar() and stat_count()
  - geom_bin2d() and stat_bin2d()
  - geom_boxplot() and stat_boxplot()
  - geom_quantile() and stat_quantile()

4. What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behaviour?

**Variables that stat_smooth() compute: **
  - y -> predicted value
  - ymin -> lower pointwise confidence interval around the mean
  - ymax -> upper pointwise confidence interval around the mean
  - se -> standard error
  
**Parameters which control stat_smooth() behaviour:**
  - method -> smoothing method (function) to use, accepts either a character vector, e.g., "auto", "lm", "glm","gam", "loess" or a function, e.g., MASS::rlm or mgcv::gam, stats::lm, or stats::loess.
  - formula -> Formula to use in smoothing function eg., y ~ x, y ~ poly(x,2), y ~ log(x)
  - level -> Level of confidence interval to use (0.95 by default)

5. In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

**Observations:**   
  - In the above two plots, setting group = 1 sets the bar heights according to the proportion whereas removing group = 1 sets the heights of the bar to be equal.


#### Position Adjustments Exercises

1. What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + geom_point()
```

**Observations:**   
  - Overplotting of the data points
  - Overplotting could be resolved by adding some random noise to each data point in the plot
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + geom_point(position = "jitter")
```
  

2. What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?

  - width : Amount of vertical and horizontal jitter. The jitter is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread is twice the value specified here.
  - height : Amount of vertical and horizontal jitter. The jitter is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread is twice the value specified here.
  If omitted, defaults to 40% of the resolution of the data: this means the jitter values will occupy 80% of the implied bins. Categorical data is aligned on the integers, so a width or height of 0.5 will spread the data so it's not possible to see the distinction between the categories.

3. Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_count()
```

**Adding color attribute**

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_count()
```


4. What’s the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualisation of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = drv, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Observations : **
  - The default position is dodge
  - i.e., placed side by side

#### Coordinate Systems Exercises

1. Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using coord_polar().

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")
```


2. What does labs() do? Read the documentation.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Class / Type of Car",
       y = "Highway miles per gallon",
       title = "Type of Car Vs Highway miles per gallon")
```


3. What’s the difference between coord_quickmap() and coord_map()?

coord_map projects a portion of the earth, which is approximately spherical, onto a flat 2D plane using any projection defined by the mapproj package. Map projections do not, in general, preserve straight lines, so this requires considerable computation. coord_quickmap is a quick approximation that does preserve straight lines. It works best for smaller areas closer to the equator.


4. What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + geom_abline() + coord_fixed()
```

**Observations:**
  - comparing the highway mileage to that of city mileage
  - line produced by geom_abline() is at 45 degree angle.
  - if we remove coord_fixed(), the angle of the line is changed.
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + geom_abline()
```
